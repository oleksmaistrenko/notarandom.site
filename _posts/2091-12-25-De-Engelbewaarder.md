Amsterdam is a popular touristic place in Europe. The popularity played a bad joke with the city: most of the food and drink places are mass-market oriented. The number of cozy places is quite small, and it takes time to locate them. [De Engelbewaarder](http://cafe-de-engelbewaarder.nl/home-en/) is one of them, located in the center of the city close to the world-famous red-light district.

The bar offers a good selection of food, both typical bar food (like bread with aioli) or normal food. There is a good selection of Dutch and Belgian beers both on tap and in the bottles. Genevier and other hard drinks are also available.

Apart from the food there are two interesting attributes of this place: pinball and temporary photo exhibitions. The pinball machines are just next to the bar. The photos are all around the place, creating something to stick to during the third glass of beer.

Three times out of three visits, the place was crowded. After some waiting we managed to get a sit on the bar and a once even a small table! So, once you arrive there, try our luck!

**Address**: Kloveniersburgwal 59HS, Amsterdam, Netherlands
