Amsterdam is a popular touristic place in Europe. The popularity played a bad joke with the city: most of the food and drink places are mass-market oriented. The number of cozy places is quite small, and it takes time to locate them. [De Engelbewaarder](http://cafe-de-engelbewaarder.nl/home-en/) is one of them, located in the center of the city close to the world-famous red-light district.

The bar offers foods and drinks.

**Address**: Kloveniersburgwal 59HS, Amsterdam, Netherlands
