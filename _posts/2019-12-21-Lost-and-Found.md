The ["Lost & Found"](https://www.facebook.com/lostandfoundkyiv/) bar in Kyiv quickly became one of my favorite bars in Kyiv. The name describes its concepts: the bar counter is created from the small boxes covered with glass. Each of the boxes contains an item that has been '_lost_' by one of the visitors. I guess the first items were brought by the bar owners, but people quickly liked the idea and started bringing their stuff to the bar. I also left a Hyperledger pin in and a sticker for the entourage of the place.

The bartenders are quite talkative. The lucky ones who sit on the bar in the calm evenings will hear a lot of stories from the history of cocktails. The bar co-owner is [Nikita](https://www.instagram.com/n.kalinichenko/) knows all the cocktail's origins. One of his stories was about **New York sour**. This cocktail is a blend of a world-famous [IBA official whiskey sour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey_sour). As it comes from the name, New York sour is a whiskey-based cocktail with freshly squeezed lemon juice, simple syrup, egg white and a twist of red wine. The idea of adding red wine to the cocktails comes from the old days when not all the ingredients were fresh enough. The red wine has hidden the smell of spoiled products. This is (hopefully!) not the case anymore, and the drink is still served. My favorite wine for this cocktail is Shiraz as quite aromatic wine.

The bar has special opening times: from Wednesday to Saturday. On the other days, the bar is closed.
