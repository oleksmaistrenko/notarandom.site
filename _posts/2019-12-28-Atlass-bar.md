The [Atlas bar](http://atlasbar.sg) in Singapore is a top-rated bar in Asia. The bar is located in the lobby of the hotel in Parkview Square. It is styled in the 1920s and offers Vintage Martini for every decade starting the 1910s. The Vintage Negroni from 1930 (London dry gin, Italian sweet vermouth, vintage Campari) for 250 SGD (approx 185 USD) is something to try out.

The bar offers all different drinks, but its main accent is the gin-based drinks. The gin is served with love and passion. I've started my tasting with a simple gin-tonic. There were several of them, and I chose one quite random. That was a citrus-flavored gin, a tonic with yuzu and a glass with a grapefruit. All well selected. Wow!

For a second drink, I've asked for a gin sour. But not a gin sour, but rather a gin sour like cocktail. The bartender looked at me for a moment, and with an 'a-ha' smile went away to do the mixture. The resulting cocktail was absolutely delicious! Being a cocktail fan, I've asked for the recipe. The bartender identified me as an East European (which is correct). The east Europeans like sloe gin. Therefore, she selected [four pillars bloody shiraz gin](https://www.fourpillarsgin.com.au/distilling/bloody-shiraz-gin/) from Australia, added a bit of absinthe and all the typical ingredients for the gin sour. The result and the client oriented-approach created a unique experience I would love to enjoy again.
